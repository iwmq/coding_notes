Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
---

I have learned data structures and algorithms from books using traditional
programming languages (aka C or Java). However, since those languages are
either my favorite or my tools of the trade, I would like to have one book
that teachs such knowledge in Python.
