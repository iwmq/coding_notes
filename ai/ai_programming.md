AI programming is now feasible for various tasks, and there exist a range of free / paid choices. Since March 2025, I started to explore AI programming tools, and have been enjoying
in them.


I haven't tried Cursor, the most popular one, as I don't want to pay extra money for it.


DeepSeeK API
---
DeepSeep API is pretty affordable and can be used in many editors, including neovim, Zed, and VS code.


VS Code
---
VS Code can be supercharged with different models via extensions.

I used WindSurf extension which provides a very handy feature that the WindSurf editor lacks: inline actions above functions.

With Roo Code extension, other models such as DeepSeek can be used.

The good new is that Copilot is available and useful in VS Code.

Since v1.100 (a.k.a April 2025 release), Copilot on VS Code is smarter and
easier to use. The agent mode is available to all users. I used it to create a
vivid demostration of the TSP problem in a single page.


WindSurf (Based On VS Code)
---
WindSurf is my first paid AI tool. I used the codeium extension (renamed to WindSurf now) in VS Code, then switched to the standalone WindSurf editor. it is useful even for free plan users.

I am lucky to be in the early bird plan so only $10/month is required instead of $15/month for Pro plan. It turns out I registed it in November 2024.


Void Editor (Based On VS Code)
---
I tried Void editor with DeepSeek. It claims to be open-source edition of Cursor, but still in beta stage.


Zed Editor
---
Zed editor is writen in Rust, so it is very fast.

I can use Zed with DeepSeek, but tool calling is not implemented with this model.


Neovim + LazyVim + avante.nvim
---
I use DeepSeek in Neovim by LazyVim and avante.nvim. There are some bugs since avante.nvim is in early stage. The most frequent bug is fail to apply AI-generated code to file.


Roo Code
---
Roo Code as extension on VS Code is also one of my early AI programming tools.
I configured it to use DeepSeek API, but I am still waiting for autocomplete.
