Notes of select papers on AI, just for fun.

Out of curiosity, I have been reading some interesting papers about AI since
2018. Early readings were on object classification from images using CNN which
turns out not much useful and faded away from everybody's talking. From 2024,
I noticed affordable and more useful applications of LLMs which is my current
hobby.

Here I put findings, confusions and thoughts on my favorite papers. They will
be easy, and the count should be less than 10.
