Fish-like autosuggestions in bash shell
---
The autosuggestions of fish are very useful. Such features also appear in Zsh
(via oh-my-zsh) and Cmder on Windows (via flink).

For Bash, I have been searching the Internet for many times without results,
until I found a blog post about ble.sh. Immediately, I installed ble.sh on my
Ubuntu box and indeed enjoy the smooth autosuggestions it offers.

Navigate Diretories With z.sh

`z.sh` is a bash script which remembers visited directories and jump between them
with a very easy way.
