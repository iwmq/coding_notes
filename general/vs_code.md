Shortcuts
----

In VS Code on linux, the default shortcuts for `copy line down / up` are
 `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + DownArrow / UpArrow`, but they do not work for some
reason, so I change them to more concise `Shift + DownArrow / UpArrow`.


Zoom Level
---
The Gnome desktop environment provides an experimental fractual scaling for
monitors with higher resolution. However, not all programs respect the scaling
feature, among which is VS Code.

To fix this, we can set a `zoom.level` in VS Code.

The help text on this settings:
```
Adjust the default zoom level for all windows. Each increment above 0 (e.g. 1) or below (e.g. -1) represents zooming 20% larger or smaller.
```
So if set to 1, VS Code will zoom to 120%.
