Here are some notes about redis source code.


Command Definitions
----

The table of commands, redisCommandTable, is defined in `/src/commands.def`,
automatically generated by `generate-command-code.py` which reads command
definitions from JSON files under the `src/commands`` directory. The whole
`commands.def` file is included by `commands.c`.

In `src/server.c`, `main()` calls `initServerConfig()` which calls
`populateCommandTable()`. In `populateCommandTable()`, each command from
`redisCommandTable` is added to commands of the global variable `server`.


Command Execution
----
To be explained.
connSocketAcceptHandler -> acceptCommonHandler -> createClient -> lookupCommand
-> lookupCommandLogic -> dictFetchValue.
