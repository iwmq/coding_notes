Firefox For Andriod
---

For Android devices without access to Google Play, installing Firefox is hard
since Mozilla does not provide a direct download link of Firefox for Andriond
on its website. Luckily I found the FTP site for all Firefox editions.

URL: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/fenix/releases/

By the way, I have no idea what is the difference between Fenix and Firefox for
Android. The two applications have different package sizes, but display same
name after installation. Mozilla says that "Fenix" is a internal code name.
