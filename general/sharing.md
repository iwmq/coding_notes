Sharing files across devices of different operating systems are not easy. Here
are some local sharing tools I use:


Air Delivery
---
Just open https://airdelivery.site/ on one device, share the flight code via
URL or QR code to other devices, then you can transfer files across devices.


hfs
---
A full-feature node.js application, run by `npx hfs`.
